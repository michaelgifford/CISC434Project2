CMPE 434 Project 2
Server backend for an Andriod chat room application

README

To get the server up and running you will first need to install node.js along with mongodb. 
Once node.js is installed on your computer run the following command in the same directory 
as the package.json file, to install the necessary dependancies:

$	npm install

Once the modules are installed run the server with the command:

$ node server.js

The server will now be running on the localhost of your machine on port 3000.
